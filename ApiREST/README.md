## Qu'est ce qu'une API
Une API (Application programming interface) is a interface that allow you to interract with other application.
You need to look at the document of a API to be able to use it ex: the documentation of paypal (https://developer.paypal.com/docs/api/overview/).
You can also decide to build your own API for your own application. This will allow developer to interact with your application in a controled environment.

## What is REST?

It is a standard. REST stands for "Representational State Transfer". It was created by Roy Fielding.
An API REST is based on http. A client do a request to the server and the server answers. The basic method are GET, PUT, POST, DELETE, etc.
To be a RESTful API, the API needs to be:
	- without state.(the server doesn't know the state of the client in between to requests).
	- Cacheable.(a client needs to be able to put data in the cache to reduce the amount of request).
	- client-server oriented.
	- with a uniform interface.
	- with a layer system.
	- code upon request.
A REST API can send JSON, XML, CSV, RSS files.

It exists also SOAP API, for 'simple Object Access Protocol'.

## Example of API

- Github: https://developer.github.com/. 
- Weather underground: 
- IBM Speech to Text: https://cloud.ibm.com/

Let's us IBM speech to text to learn about API. Search for "Speech to text".
Click on "Create" to activate this service. then on "Service Credentials".
You NEED TO use this Tutorial: https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-gettingStarted#getting-started-tutorial.

curl -X POST -u "apikey:{apikey}" \
--header "Content-Type: audio/flac" \
--data-binary @/home/quentin/Downloads/audio-file.flac \
"{url}/v1/recognize"

change apikey and {url} {apikey} by the data provided by IBM.

curl -X POST -u "apikey:{apikey} \
--header "Content-Type: application/json" \
--data "{\"text":\" The IBMÂ® Text to Speech service provides an Application Programming Interface (API) that uses IBM's speech-synthesis capabilities to convert text to an audio signal. The service provides a Representational State Transfer (REST) interface that lets you synthesize written text into natural-sounding speech in a variety of languages, accents, and voices. The service currently synthesizes text from English, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Spanish, or Brazilian Portuguese into audio spoken in a male or female voice (the service supports only a single gender for some languages).\"}" \
--output text.wav \
"{url}/v1/synthesize"

## Ressources

Les ressources sont le coeur de l'api. c'est ce que le client vient chercher et ce aue le serveur renvoie. Les API sont basee sur un systeme d'URI.
